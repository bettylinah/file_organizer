# üóÇÔ∏è File Organizer

A simple yet powerful Python script that automatically organizes files in a given folder into categories like **Documents**, **Images**, **Videos**, **Music**, and more.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Automatically sorts files by their extension.
- Creates neatly structured folders for each category.
- Prevents overwriting by renaming duplicates.
- Supports **undo** to reverse all file moves.
- Logs all activity in `organized_output/organize_log.json`.

## üß† How It Works
When you run the script, it:
1. Scans your target folder (e.g., `sample_files`).
2. Detects each file‚Äôs type (image, document, video, etc.).
3. Creates subfolders inside `organized_output/`.
4. Moves each file into its matching category.
